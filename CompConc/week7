Hello everyone and welcome to week 7 !

We are almost done with this course which means that if you still haven't finished all your assignments up to Learning Plan 7, It's time to get it done now !

Before getting into this week's details, I want to make an important announcement. This course fully prepares you for the CompTIA A+ certification. 

This certification is a very valuable one and would make you stand out when applying for IT Jobs. I highly recommend that everyone of you plan to take the certification exams right after 

the course when all the information is still fresh in your heads.

If you have any questions regarding the certification, do not hesitate to ask me.

In this week we are going to learn more about system security, printers & mobile devices. Security is of course one of the most challenging topics but also very interesting. You will learn

about file encryption techniques and also you would learn about firewalls. You will also learn all about printing configuration and how to print over a network and troubleshoot printing

problems. Finally, you would have to chance to learn about mobile devices networking and troubleshooting.
