Hello learners,

This course will deepen your understanding and clear any misconceptions that you may have about computer hardware and software. In this course, you will learn how to install various hardware and software packages. Also you will learn some troubleshooting techniques and many IT concepts that professionals use nowadays.

I'm your instructor for this course and let me briefly introduce myself: I'm a member of the Linux foundation and a certified Linux system administrator.
I have a passion for teaching Linux skills in various platforms such as Udemy. I have also attained multiple IT certifications from Oracle and Linux Foundation. Java is my favourite programming language. This course will begin from the very start but it will also go a long way. It's going to be a lot of effort but I promise you it will also be a lot of fun.

Feel free to send me emails with questions or feedback at any time during the week. I will also dedicate hours from 1p.m to 4p.m (Mountain Time) on Sundays as office hours to give you feedback on all your questions. Please feel free to introduce yourselves in the discussion forums if you have not already done so. You can mention things such as your career background and what's your expectation from this course or any other thing that comes to your mind.

Below is what you have to submit for the first week assignment (Due this coming Sunday).

Non-Graded LP1.1 Discussion: Introduction

Graded LP1.1 Assignment: Introduction to your Computer
Graded LP1.2 Assignment: Introduction to your Computer
