Hello everyone and welcome to week 2 !


In this week we are going to learn about the components that defines and make our computer (System components).

Also we are going to learn about various kinds of peripherals devices and what do we mean by peripheral devices in the first place.

We are also going to talk about processors for this week's discussion.

Here is a you tube video that I think will help you with this week's discussion AMD vs Intel 

Also here is a link that you will also find helpful which chipmaker does processors better?

I hope that everyone by know is able to access TestOut. As I said in the email, you have to access TestOut from with the D2L platform (refer back to the email if you still have troubles).

Here is your assignment for this week. 


Remember discussions are due Thursdays (11:59 pm) and TestOut exercises are due on Sundays (11:59 pm) 

Processors Discussion LP2.1

Ahmed
