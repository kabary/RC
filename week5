Hello everyone and welcome to week 5!

Now we are in the second half of our course.


In this week we are going to learn about the basics of systems administration with a focus on the windows operating systems. A system administrator is basically someone who takes care of the whole system. Making sure the system is secured and there are no problems with the networks. Also a systems administrator has to backup the system regularly and manage user accounts and permissions.

For this weeks discussion, I want you address the problem that will arise if all the the users on a system are granted the same permissions as the systems administrator himself. What can happen in this case ?

 Here is a link that that  will help you with this weeks assignments
