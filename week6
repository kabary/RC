Hello everyone and welcome to week 6 !


In this week we are going to learn more about windows system administration. You will learn about the booting process (the initialisation processes that takes place once you power on your computer till you login). You will also learn everything about the windows installation process and you would learn the basics of virtualisation.  

Then you would learn how to manage file permissions on windows and a little bit of managing files on the Linux operating system.


Notice the differences and the similarity between file management on Linux & Window. Which do you think is easier ? More efficient ? Just share your opinion

For this week's discussion, you are required to think of an occupation or industry where file and folder security would be important, how can a Network administrator keep these files secure , What steps could be taken to prevent sensitive material from being accessed, or worseâ€”stolen?

Here is a link that will help you with this week's discussion
