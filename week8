Hello everyone and welcome to the final week of the course !

First of all, I would like to say that I am proud of all your hard work so far, It takes determination and great management skills to make it through an online course.

Secondly, I urge those of you who still didn't finish all their assignments and discussions to finish them all by the end of this week. I have to submit your final grades next Wednesday 

(August 3rd).

In this week, You are going to learn how to troubleshoot a malfunctioning computer system, you will also learn how to troubleshoot a mobile device and how to troubleshoot 

system startup boot problems.
